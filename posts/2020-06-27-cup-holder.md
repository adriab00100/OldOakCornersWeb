## Let's make a cup holder

### The problem
Alex previously had a bed that was full-size (it was a converted frame from his original crib when he was a baby) with fairly wide headboard and footboard.
He had gotten used to placing a cup of water on his headboard for easy access when he was sleeping. Wake up thirsty, take a drink, go back to bed. No fuss,
no problem.

However, he just upgraded to a bunk bed that has a futon underneath that he can use as a couch, or his cousin can sleep on when he is visiting. This bunk 
bed, while fantastic, does not have wide enough spaces for Alex's water cup to fit on. So what do we do? We go to the workshop of course!

### The design

I wanted something that could hang off the outside of his bed rail since the top rails were pretty high up, this would be pretty convenient while still being
out of the way while he was sleeping. I ended up going with an octagon shape for the main holder, with a kind of "hook" that would slide over the side board
that prevented him from rolling out of the bed.

Turns out I hadn't done any reasonable amount of trigonometry in quite some time so I had to run the equations a few times (after I looked them up to make sure
I was doing the right thing in the first place). After getting all my mathematics lined up and ready to go I selected a left-over piece of hard maple that I 
had used for another project as the perfect piece and started.

The leftovers I used came from this project

### The Build
I started with the table saw, and cut one long trapezoid piece that I then cut up into 10 segments (8 for the octagon cup holder + spares in case I screwed up)

The sawing all went pretty well so I moved on to the next step. I wanted to put a 1/4-inch plywood floor into the octagonal cup holder portion, so next I pulled
out the scariest tool I own, the router. It went... ok, but I had some tear-out.
