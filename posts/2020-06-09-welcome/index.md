## Hello and welcome

I'm still actively building this blog as I start to post, so things might look a little funny for a while while I learn exactly what kind of styles, fonts, and colors I want to apply across the site.

Want to learn more about what Old Oak Corners is, and how I got here? Take a peek at the [About page](/about)

Here's to building new things, and thanks for taking a look at the very first blog post on this site! Instead of reading more content, please enjoy looking at this mallet.
