## Mallet Madness

### The story

Jointer's. Carver's. Carpenter's. Woodworker's. Crafter's.

There are a lot of people who like to use a simple wooden mallet, and, as it turns out, it is a really nice and simple project to do yourself. In my case, however, I reached out to a few people to see
if anyone needed a mallet so I could practice making them. They can be rounded or square-ish, or anywhere in between, and made from any wood that you like as long as it is strong and heavy enough
for what you need.

### The plan

Mallets are so easy in planning. You have a head and a handle and that's it. Everything after that is details. If you build it so the handle wants to stay in the head during use due to friction, everything is a lot easier.

### The build

#### Starting with a failed experiment

I started my mallet adventure years ago with a simple 4x4 chunk of cedar I grabbed from Lowes. I didn't want to try anything fancy since I didn't have any experience, so I went simple. Cedar block head,
and an oak handle in a rectangular shape. After years of use and abuse it finally failed on me. The head broke, but the handle was fine. I can re-use the handle and cut a new head.

I happened to have a few promising pieces of wood that I snagged from my older brother's firewood stack. He happened to cut some damaged ash down, which would be perfect for a new mallet head.

#### Experimenting a-round

Natallia bought me a delightful lathe for my birthday/christmas and I just had to learn how to use it. I had a surprisingly squared piece of firewood that I wanted to try turning into a mallet head.

After having a fright where the head blank escaped the lathe and launched off across the shop and tried to attack Natallia I was able to cut things down to size and get it to a more reasonable size.

I had a piece of sapling lying around from ages ago that I quickly carved down into a handle. Just a small amount of oil for the exterior and it is done.

#### Redcedar (Juniper) mallet for a friend

My good friend Zach was interested in a new wooden mallet, and I had some good stock sitting and waiting to be used. Redcedar, also known as Juniper, is a colorful and aromatic wood that should work well for mallets. He was interested in a a mallet with a rectangular head and a rounded handle. All in all, a very straight forward setup.

First I had to turn a rectangular piece into a cylinder. Time to get out the lathe.

In order for the handle to not slide out, I actually need to have two different diameters. Larger for the top, and slightly smaller for the rest of the handle so friction itself could hold it in place. First I turned the handle down to the larger size and tested it wouldn't fit. Next, I turned the piece again bringing the handle to its final diameter, just barely smaller than the hole I bored in the mallet head.

After a few small adjustments with sand paper, I got the fit I was looking for. I didn't use any glue for this setup, just friction. I finished it with two coats of Tung oil.

#### A mallet for a coworker

My co-worker, Dillon, was interested in having a wooden mallet for general purpose mallet-needs. I had a lovely piece of heavy dense firewood that was already nearly square
that would be great to start with. He wanted a mallet with a round head, and round handle. I started with the handle, which was a maple sapling. I turned that to remove the bark, and get it to a proper diameter, and then moved on to the mallet head.

Before I get to the woodturning portion of the mallet head, I have some prep to do with the piece of firewood. First up, cut it down to a rough size with squared up planes for each face. Then drill out the handle hole.

After the handle hole was bored out, I decided to remove the corners of the mallet head with my table saw so I wouldn't have so much material to take off on the lathe. This left me with an octagonal mallet head, which actually looked pretty cool.

Finally I was able to round it down to the final size, and clean it up with some sand paper. The test fit showed it fits together well, but I would need to trim the handle shorter.

### In summary

Building wooden mallets is really fun, and you have a lot of ways to explore different techniques. There are choices on wood, shape, finish, and size! Interestingly, I have not yet made a laminated mallet where I glue three boards together with a handle. Maybe I'll try that soon.
