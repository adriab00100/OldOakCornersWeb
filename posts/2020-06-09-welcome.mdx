## Hello and welcome

This post marks the start of this blog. I'm dedicating this little spot on the internet to my posts and ramblings in and around wood-working and other building projects.
I post without any real schedule, sometimes several times in a month, and sometimes several months without a post.

Anything with a post date earlier than this post was posted retroactively.

Want to learn more about what Old Oak Corners is, and how I got here? Take a peek at the [About page](/about)

Here's to building new things, and thanks for taking a look at the very first blog post on this site! Instead of reading more content, please enjoy looking at this mallet.
